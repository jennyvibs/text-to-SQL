# Text to SQL using Gemini Pro

## Overview

The **Text to SQL using Gemini Pro** project is designed to transform natural language text into SQL queries using advanced language models (LLMs). This project enables users to interact with large datasets without the need for SQL expertise. By leveraging LLMs, users can obtain meaningful insights and answers from complex data structures through simple textual queries.

## Use Case

This project addresses the challenge of querying large databases for non-technical users. By converting user input in natural language into SQL queries, it simplifies the process of data extraction and analysis. Key benefits include:

- **Ease of Use**: Allows non-technical users to obtain data insights without writing SQL code.
- **Time Efficiency**: Reduces the time spent on manually figuring out database schema, columns, and rows.
- **Automation**: Streamlines the querying process by training the LLM with the given database schema and dictionaries, automating complex data tasks.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts user input in plain text into SQL queries.
- **Database Integration**: Connects with various databases to fetch and return query results.
- **Customizable**: Configurable to work with different databases and schema definitions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Gemini Pro LLM or similar NLP model
- Access to the database you wish to query
- Relevant Python libraries (e.g., `google`, `pandas`,`numpy`,`sqlite3`)

## Drawbacks and Considerations

1. **Model Limitations**: The accuracy of SQL queries generated by LLMs depends on the quality of the training data and the complexity of the database schema. Misinterpretations may occur, especially with ambiguous or complex queries.

2. **Performance**: Large or complex queries may lead to performance issues, such as slower response times or increased computational requirements.

3. **Data Privacy and Compliance**:
   - **Data Exposure**: Sending queries through an LLM may expose sensitive data if not properly secured. Ensure that privacy measures are in place to protect data.
   - **Compliance Issues**: Using LLMs may introduce compliance challenges, especially with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA. Make sure to assess and adhere to relevant data protection laws and company policies.

4. **Training Requirements**: Effective use of the LLM requires appropriate training with accurate database schema and dictionaries. This process can be time-consuming and requires expertise.
